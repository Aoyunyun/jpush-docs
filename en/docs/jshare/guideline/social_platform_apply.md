# Third-party Platform Application

## Why do I need to apply for a third-party platform account?

The information such as application information, application name, and application icon displayed after the application is successfully shared with QQ, WeChat and Sina Weibo is related to the settings of third-party open platforms. Therefore, the application needs to be created and approved through a third-party open platform.

## Apply for appID of QQ
